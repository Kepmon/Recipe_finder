[This website](https://kepmon.github.io/Recipe_finder/) was created in order to practice using REST API.

Due to certain limitations regarding the API response, I wasn't able to design this website exactly the way I would like. For example, the actual recipe (meaning the step-by-step cooking description) was not provided in this API response, therefore, I couln't put it up on my website. Instead, one can see this recipe by going to an external webpage (linked at the end of "Read more" section); hovewer, some links are not available anymore. I believe, the abovementioned issue is the main drawback of this website but, unfortunately, I can't really do anything to change it. Moreover, the results section consists of only 20 recipes, again, due to the limitations of the API response.

Nevertheless, I still decided to use this particular API since it allowed me to learn much of how to work with relatively big amount of the response data, which was my main goal in the case of this website.
