### UPDATE
As a part of my 'remove-all-crappy-code-from-my-github' goal, this project is currently being refactored, using Astro, Svelte, TypeScript, and SCSS. It's being rewriting from scratch, with the following goals in mind:
* add non-existent accessibility
* improve on CSS/SCSS
* improve on best practices of writing JS/TS, with particular emphasis on maintability
* improve on design, at least a little bit

Due to the new version of the website being on a very early stage of development, I'm sharing two links for the live preview:
* 'Old Link' - containing the old version of the website (not fully working as it turns out ðŸ™ˆ)
* 'New Link' - containing the most recent version of the website but not containing a significant part of its functionality, since it is still being developed

When I'm done with this project's refactoring, only a new link will be available and the content of this README will be appropriately adjusted.

### Old Content
Due to certain limitations regarding the API response, I wasn't able to design this website exactly the way I wanted. For example, the actual recipe (meaning the step-by-step cooking description) was not provided in this API response, therefore, I couln't put it up on my website. Instead, one can see this recipe by going to an external website (linked at the end of "Read more" section); hovewer, some links are not available anymore. I believe, the abovementioned issue is the main drawback of this website but, unfortunately, I can't really do anything to change it. Moreover, the results section consists of only 20 recipes, again, due to the limitations of the API response.

Nevertheless, I still decided to use this particular API simply because I wasn't really able to find a better (free) one.
